				<p>
					As technology progresses, we are using ever more digital tools and services. 
					Statistic from SBB show that internet usage from the Norwegian population has 
					increased from 7%<a href="sources_en.html">[9]</a> to 96%<a href="sources_en.html">[10]</a> 
					in just 20 years. As a result of this, we leave behind 
					bigger and more substantial amounts of personal data at the different providers 
					of digital services. As well as at companies which are based on collection 
					and selling of data. Some of which is information we freely hand out, but a 
					large portion of this information that is obtained, is assembled without the 
					knowledge of the user.
				</p>
				<p>
					Statistics from SBB’s yearly examination about Norwegians Media habits 
					substantiates the claim that we in an increasing degree live “online”.

					Collection of information:
					The collection of user data accurse in many different forms/processes. 
					Some of them more apparent than others. In todays society most of them are 
					known for taking in huge sizes of data through the use of social Media platforms. 
					But how many individuals have an overview over which authorizations we allow these 
					Service providers to posses, by accepting the terms and conditions of these Services.
				</p>
				<p>Therefore the average user isn’t aware of other data, that gets collected via:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Browser-trackers
					<li>Browser fingerprints
					<li>Location Services
					<li>Smartphone applications
					<li>"Smart"-gadgets with connectivity (IoT)
				</ul>
				<p> Our vision is thereby:</p>
				<p>
					We wish to establish a larger awareness over collection of data and how these are passed down. 
					The main challenge to achieve this lies within that the average user has difficulties to 
					get an overview over the amount of digital footprints that are left behind via browsers, 
					smartphones and other connected units.
